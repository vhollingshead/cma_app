 Beware of illegal recruiters! Here are the signs of an illegal recruiter:

Not Registered with POEA: Always check the recruitment agency's status on the POEA website to see if they are licensed, suspended, permanently banned, or closed.
Immediate Request for Placement Fee Without Receipt: Legitimate agencies will always provide an official receipt for any payments.
Medical Exam Without Clear Employer: Ensure you know the specific employer before undergoing any medical exams.
Lack of Job Details: Be cautious if the recruiter is secretive about the job details.
Tourist Visa Instead of Working Visa: Applying for a tourist visa with the intent to work is illegal and unsafe.
Promises of Quick Departure: Legitimate job processes take time, so be wary of promises for quick departures.
No Valid ID: Always ask for valid identification from the recruiter.
No Employment Contract: A reputable job offer always includes a contract.
No Office: Insist on meeting at the agency’s office, not in informal places.
Showcases Success Stories: Be skeptical of success claims without verifiable proof.     "
