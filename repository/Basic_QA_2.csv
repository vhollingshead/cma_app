Contract Type:
In addition, our contract type whether permanent, temporary, or long-term, can directly affect the entitlement of end of service benefits in KSA.
State of residence:
Also, our state of residence in Arabia may affect our entitlement to benefits.
Employee Benefits:
These are benefits that may be provided to us by our employer, such as a housing allowance, transportation allowance, or health insurance. These can affect our compensation package and influence the amount of end of service benefits in KSA.

Now that we have explored a little of the causes of us as employees that may be detrimental to us when calculating the amount of our gratitude, let us look at the causes that may be unfavorable to us when terminating our contracts:

Reason for termination
Termination for misconduct:

We will not owe gratitude to someone who terminates us for misconduct. This includes policy violations, illegal acts, or any other malicious behavior.
Voluntary resignation:

We are entitled to gratitude according to the established rules if we resign of our own free will. They will calculate this based on our length of service and base salary.

Our company is entitled to our end of service benefits in KSA if we have a complete closure. The amount will be as per applicable rules.

In addition, this includes increases. decreases and their legal compliance, let us see how to use an end of service benefits calculator Saudi Arabia:

Calculation of gratitude in case of termination:
According to Article 84 of the Saudi labor law, the employees are entitled to the following end of service benefits in case of termination.
½ of salary during the first 5 years for each year of service.
For each year of service after the first 5 years, full salary.
We need to know that we will not have the privilege of end of service benefits in KSA if they terminate us under Article 80 of the Saudi labor law.
Calculation in case of resignation:
Resignation within the first 2 years: we do not have end of service benefits in KSA.
Resignation between 2 and 5 years: we have the benefit of 1/3 of our ESB award.
Potential adjustments:
Annual increase: If we have an annual increase this could affect when using an end of service benefits calculator Saudi Arabia for our bonus.
Job promotion: In addition, when we move up our base salary generally increases.
Merit: In some cases, these are raises based on our incredible performance.
Reduction of hours: Also, if our working hours are reduced, our base salary will go down and that will affect our end of service benefits in KSA.
Disciplinary Sanctions: Also, if we have poor performance or misconduct, we may be subject to salary reductions.
Demotion: Also, if we are demoted from a position, our salary will go down and this will directly affect us when using an End of service benefits in KSA calculator for our benefits.

Our length of service is another fundamental factor when calculating our benefits. let us take a look at how we can calculate them:

Threshold of our length of service:
We must have worked for at least a minimum of 2 continuous years with the same employer. If we have a shorter duration, they will not give us end of service benefits in KSA.
Specific calculation:
We calculate the amount of gratuity based on our length of service and our basic salary.
The company awards us ½ of the basic salary for each year of our service for the first 5 years.
After 5 years, the company will give us the full salary for each additional year.
A clear example would be an employee who worked for 7 years with a basic salary of 10,000 SAR/month.
ESB for our first 5 years = 5 years x 10,000 / 2 = 25.00 SAR.
For a later period = 2 years x 10,000 = 20,000 SAR.
Total = 45,000 SAR.

In Saudi Arabia, we have two main employment contracts. The fixed employment contract, and open-ended employment contracts. These can affect the eligibility for end of service benefits in KSA:

Fixed employment contract:
These contracts establish a specific duration for us. Additionally, we calculate benefits based on our full-time service. At the end of this contract. We are entitled to receive a bonus based on our length of service (minimum 2 years) and basic salary at the end of this contract.
Indefinite employment contract:
We or our employer decide when these end, as they are not based on having a specific date. Additionally, they calculate the gratuity to us based on all the full-time work and our total basic salary at the time of termination.
Additionally, our employers must follow the procedures outlined in Arabian law fairly and legally to terminate an indefinite employment contract."
